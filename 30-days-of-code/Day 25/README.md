# [Day 25: Running Time and Complexity](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-running-time-and-complexity/problem)

## Objective
Today we're learning about running time! Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-running-time-and-complexity/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
A prime is a natural number greater than *1* that has no positive divisors other than *1* and itself. Given a number, *n*, determine and print whether it's *Prime* or *Not prime*.

**Note:** If possible, try to come up with a *O(sqrt(n))* primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an *O(n)* algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer, *T*, the number of test cases.
Each of the *T* subsequent lines contains an integer, *n*, to be tested for primality.

## Constraints
* *1 <= T <= 30*
* *1 <= n <= 2x10^9*

## Output Format
For each test case, print whether *n* is *Prime* or *Not prime* on a new line.

## Run
