# [Day 9: Recursion 3](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion/problem)

## Objective
Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial
* *factorial(n) = { 1 if N <= 1, N x factorial(N - 1) otherwise*

## Task
Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, *N* as a parameter and prints the result of *N!* (*N* factorial).

**Note:** If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of *0*.

## Input Format
A single integer, *N* (the argument to pass to factorial).

## Constraints
* *2 <= N <= 12*
* *Your submission must contain a recursive function named factorial.*

## Output Format
Print a single integer denoting *N!*.

## Run
Set the path and name of file for output, as below:
> export OUTPUT_PATH=<path>

Run the code
> python3 solution.py

Input the desired value
> 2
